# Telegram Word Bot

A simple Telegram bot that analyses a given word, built with [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

The bot is fairly useless - unless you often need to know how many letters or vowels are in a word.

It was built as a simple demonstration of how to build a Telegram bot in Python and deploy it to Heroku.
